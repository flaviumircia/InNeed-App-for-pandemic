# Android Application for help during the SARS-COV2 pandemic
My first Android application ever, presented on "Scientific Communications Session 2021 ".

## About the app
   Not the greatest and totally not finished, but everyone starts from somewhere.
   
   The app ("InNeed") should be a social app for the SARS-COV2 lockdown/quarantine, where people that are quaratined could seek for help on the application.
   
   Something like delivery app, but with no payment included (basically good old volunteering)
   
   Because the time was short and I couldn't do all the features neccessary for the app to work. So I built the an UI that shows your coordinates on the world map.
  
     
## UI
   The UI is simplistic (pretty much a lot of grey) with the logo being a Hygieia's symbol (the old greek symbol used in pharmas with the snake and the cup)
   
   Contains 3 layouts (the login, sign up and main_map layout)
